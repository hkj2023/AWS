A product recommendation system has become an essential component of modern e-commerce platforms, helping users access various catalogs by suggesting items aligned with their interests, preferences, and behavior. These systems enhance user satisfaction, drive engagement and sales by personalizing the shopping experience.
Among various recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering stands out for its ability to learn from historical user-item interactions without relying on detailed product metadata. By identifying patterns in user behavior such as views, clicks, or purchases collaborative filtering predicts what a user might be interested in based on the preferences of similar users. This approach is particularly effective in environments where explicit ratings are limited and user behavior & feedback is the primary source of data.
In the context of the online marketplace Jiji Ethiopia, applying a personalized recommendation system could significantly improve product discovery and user satisfaction. Whenever the platform grows and user needs are increasing, difficulty in locating relevant items across diverse categories and listings might be happened. A collaborative filtering-based solution offers the best and scalable way to address the challenges listed in this introduction.
